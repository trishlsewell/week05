 * 		Table
 * 2. Encapsulation
 * 		Driving a car - the private goings on of the car (how a car works)
 * 3. Inheritance
 * 		Allows objects or classes to inherit from parent classes. 
 * 4. Polymorphism
 * 		Something can take different forms
 * 		Animals communicate - 
 * 			Dogs, Cats, Bears all communicate in different ways, but it's the same activity
 * 			The "Method" communicate can take different forms.
 * 
 * Class - is how we structure our code in OOP.
 * Class is like a blue print
 * An object is the actual product developed from the blueprint
 * An object is an Instance of a class
